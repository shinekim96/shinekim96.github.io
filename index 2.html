          <p><strong>Kwang Taik Kim</strong>, Ph.D., is a Research Assistant Professor of <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE">Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Purdue University.</p>
<p>As a communications and networking researcher, he is particularly interested in 5G/NextG ajar/open RAN architectures, open edge platforms, implementation aspects of digital communications, real-time wireless networking protocols and large-scale distributed computing, and machine learning in the realms of wireless system design. His research is primarily focused on providing feasibility studies for cutting-edge theoretical breakthroughs in wireless communications and networking through experimentation with 5G and NextG wireless systems.</p>
<p>Kwang is a co-author of more than 35 research articles and holds 51 issued U.S. and worldwide patents, as well as over 10 pending patent applications. He has received funding from a variety of sources, including Wistron, Cisco, the United States Army Research Lab, AT&amp;T, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, and NineTwelve. He is now heading various initiatives on open edge platforms, Wi-Fi 6 and 5G network protocols, and software radio architectures to enable reliable autonomous systems. He co-authored the book 5G System Design – Architectural and Functional Considerations and Long Term Research (Wiley, 2018).</p>
<p>He received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from KAIST, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University. In addition to his academic position, he serves as an Executive Technology Advisor for the Purdue Research Foundation. Prior to joining Purdue, he worked at Samsung Electronics and Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology as a Principal Engineer and Senior Research Staff Member, respectively. He is the recipient of <a href="https://www.sigmobile.org/mobihoc/2021/awards.html">2021 ACM MobiHoc Best Paper Award</a>, the 2016 Samsung Best Paper Award (Gold Prize) for Communication and Network Division, the 2014 Samsung CEO Award of Honor for Technical Division, and the 2013 Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology President Award for Infinity Research R&amp;D. Kwang has had the honor of conducting research with multiple postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and industry engineers, and he is interested in bridging the divide between theory and practice. To that end, he has served as a contributing member of the ATIS Next G Alliance’s National 6G Roadmap and Technology Working Groups.</p>
